    "<p> The creative project is about conducting a real-world machine learning project on your own, with everything that is involved. Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The past programming projects provide templates for how to do this (and you can reuse part of your code if you wish), and the lectures provide some of the methods you can use. So, this creative project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",

Language helps us interpret the nuances of joy, sadness, anger, and love, allowing us to connect with others on a deeper level. Are you able to train an ML model that recognizes the human emotions expressed in a piece of text? <b>Please read the project description PDF file carefully and follow the instructions there.

    "1.4.1 How did you formulate the learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "We formulated the learning problem as a text classification problem where we are \n",
    "given an input text and our goal is to predict the emotion of the text. In particular, \n",
    "we are given an input text as a string and our goal is to classify the text into 1 of\n",
    "28 different classes (labeled 0 to 27) representing the semantic emotion of the text. Hence, we formulated\n",
    "this learning problem as a multi-class classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the text input useful for machine learning, we need to transform the input\n",
    "text into vector representations that can be used by our training algorithms. There are several ways\n",
    "we can vectorize our text, but we decided to use the TF-IDF and Bag of Words vectorization\n",
    "methods, which we will explain why later on when explain the our model selection. \n",
    "The Bag of Words embeddings represent text as vectors of word frequencies, but doesn't consider\n",
    "the order of words. On the other hand, TF-IDF embeddings weight the frequency of words\n",
    "against how often they appear, which highlights more unique words and reduces the weight\n",
    "of commonly used words. To perform these sentence embeddings, we used the sci-kit learn's\n",
    "TfidfVectorizer and CounterVectorizer, which handles the tokenization of the input text and vector output.\n",
    "When tokenizing the text, for both vectorizers, we decided to exclude stop words like \"and\" and \"the\" as they\n",
    "do not contribute much to the emotion of a text and can add noise to our vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4.2 Which two learning methods from class did you choose and why did you made the choices?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the two learning methods from class, we decided to use the SVM and Naive Bayes training algorithms. \n",
    "While researching which algorithms to use for this text classification problem, we came across the paper\n",
    "\"Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines\" by Thorsten Joachims. In the paper, Joachims \n",
    "explores how SVMs are particularly effective at text categorization problems. In particular, \n",
    "the paper argues that SVMs are well suited for text categorization since they can \n",
    "handle high-dimensional features spaces well, which is common in text data. Additionally,\n",
    "the paper explain how many text classification problems are linearly seperable in high-dimensional\n",
    "feature space, which would make SVMs more effective by maximizing margins between classes. For these reasons,\n",
    "we decided to use SVM as one of our learning methods. For the vector embeddings used as inputs\n",
    "to the SVM model, we chose to use the TF-IDF embeddings since they provide normalized\n",
    "weights for terms, which would help prevent the decision boundaries from being skewed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second learning method, we decided to use Naive Bayes since we felt that it\n",
    "was the most intuitive. The Naive Bayes training algorithm assumes that the \n",
    "features, which in this case are the words, are conditionally independent given the\n",
    "label, which means that the presence or frequency of a word contributes independently \n",
    "to determining the label. Intuitively, text withs words that appear more frequently in a \n",
    "text of a certain label should have a higher probability of being assigned that label.\n",
    "However, we are aware that this assumption of feature independence most likely\n",
    "will not hold for most text since words in text are often correlated, combining to \n",
    "create emotion. While we predict that Naive Bayes would be less effective than SVM due\n",
    "to its relative simplicity, we decided to use Naive Bayes as a baseline for the\n",
    "other text classification methods. For the Naive Bayes model, we used the bag \n",
    "of words embeddings instead of TF-IDF used with the SVM model. \n",
    "This is because Naive Bayes assumes that the features are conditionally\n",
    "independent given the class label, which aligns with the bag of words embeddings,\n",
    "since it only represents the frequency of the terms and doesn't add any additional\n",
    "weights. Hence the freqency of each word in the bag of words embeddings are\n",
    "directly interpreted as a probabilities by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.4.3 How did you do the model selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "For both SVM and Naive Bayes models, we did hyperparameter tuning to find the best hyperparameters.\n",

    "For the C value, we tested the values: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]. We chose\n",
    "these values as they provide a wide range of C values and we limited the highest C\n",
    "to 10 since we didn't want to choose a C that would overfit the training examples\n",
    "too much, as a higher C value caused the model to place more importance on minimizing \n",
